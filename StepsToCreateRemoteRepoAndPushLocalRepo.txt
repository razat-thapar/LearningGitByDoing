Steps to push local repo changes to remote repo with unrelated histories. 
1. Create a remote repo on github. 
2. Add the placeholder say"downstream" in local using
   git remote add downstream <remote url> <branch name> 
3. pull the remote repo with unrelated histories flag. 
   git pull --allow-unrelated-histories <placeholder> <branchname>
4. push the changes to the remote repo from local. 
   git push <placeholder> <branchname> 
5. Done! this way all the changes will be reflected in remote and both will have same histories now.
