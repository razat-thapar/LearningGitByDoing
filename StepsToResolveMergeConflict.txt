What is MergeConflict ? 
Scenario: Two branches , where feat branch is forked at B commit , so, main and feat have common histories. 

Now,reviewers committed some changes in file1.txt at line 1 of main branch. 
say, "adding a new feature <button>"

Parallely, some developer committed some changes in file1.txt at line1 of feat branch.
say, "adding a new feature <label>"

    A---B---C(file1.txt) (main)
        |
	B---D(file1.txt) (feat)
now, developer tries to sync his branch (feat) with recent changes in main. 
> currently on feat branch. 
> git merge main 

#######Problem:  Merge conflict happens, unable to merge histories until conflicts are resolved manually.
#######FIX: 
Option 1: Delete main changes + add new changes of feat branch. 
Option 2: Delete changes of feat branch. + add new changes of main branch.  
Option 3: keep both.
Option 4: Delete both.
